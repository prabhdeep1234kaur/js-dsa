    <h3>Sorts</h3>

    <li>https://visualgo.net/en/sorting</li>
    <li>Bubble sort : replaces each element with its next if it is greater (2 loops)</li>
    <li>Selection sort : replaces each element with its next if it is greater (2 loops)</li>
    <li>Merge sort : divide arr into two parts and further two part and keep on comparing later on then</li>
    <h3>Quick Sort</h3>
    <li>saves a lot of time because of its space and time complexity</li>
    <li>faster</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a pivot (usually first index)</li>
        <li>creates arrays into two part : less than pivot and more than pivot</li>
        <li>sort those two: assign a new pivot and again sort more than pivot and less than and go on sorting those arrays </li>
        <li>Call the function itself</li>
    </ul>
